## Starter templates for JS and TS

### Requirements

It is assumed that the spinjs binary is available in path (Possibly later moved into spin plugins and therefore not required to be in the path).

## Building the templates

```
npm install
spin build
```

## Running the templates

```
spin up --follow-all
```
